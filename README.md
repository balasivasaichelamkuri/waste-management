# waste-management
This project uses Transfer Learning to automate waste classification using image recognition. A pre-trained deep learning model (like MobileNetV2 or ResNet50) is fine-tuned on a custom waste dataset to classify images into categories such as organic, recyclable, hazardous, and general waste. The goal is to support smarter, more effecince.
